# JustAnotherPomodoro

Simple and beautiful Pomodoro timer made with plain JS, HTML and CSS. **Made for educational purposes mostly.** This software has no warranty, so if alarm sound won't play and you lost your precious brake time, don't blame me.

# Functionality

This is just simple pomodoro timer, but I added some nice things:

 - Random **beautiful** wallpapers
 - Fullscreen button (mostly for mobile devices)
 - Responsive design - It will **Probably** work on all types of screens
 - Customizable work and rest times
 - Time displaying in the browser tab
