# JustAnotherPomodoro

Simple and beautiful Pomodoro timer made with plain JS, HTML and CSS. **Made for educational purposes mostly.** This software has no warranty, so if alarm sound won't play don't blame me.

# Functionality

This is just simple pomodoro timer, but I added some nice things:

 - Random **beautiful** wallpapers

 - Custom work and rest time
