# JustAnotherPomodoro

Simple and beautiful Pomodoro timer made with plain JS, HTML and CSS. **Made for educational purposes mostly.** This software has no warranty, so if alarm sound won't play and you lost your precious brake time, don't blame me.

# What is pomodoro

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

This is just simple pomodoro timer, but I added some nice things:

 - Random **beautiful** wallpapers
 - Fullscreen button (mostly for mobile devices)
 - Responsive design - It will **Probably** work on all types of screens
 - Customizable work and rest times
 - Time displaying in the browser tab
